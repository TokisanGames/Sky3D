This folder contains debugging images, which are used to verify that the sun and moon are in their real world positions.

To use, open up Sky3D's TimeOfDay node, then,

- Under Current Time, set the day, month, and year to match the datetimes indicated in the image filenames.
- Under Planetary And Location, set the latitude, longitude, and UTC to match the Royal Observatory: Latitude = 51.477 degrees, Longitude = 0 degrees, UTC = 0 hours.

This folder currently contains the following examples for the Royal Observatory,

- 3-1-2026, 0200-0600, moonset
- 3-1-2026, 0700-1000, sunrise
- 8-31-2026, 2000-2300, moonrise
- 9-1-2026, 0500-0900, sunrise

Note: it may also be worth including example images for the Southern Hemisphere, which would help find sign errors, if they exist.
